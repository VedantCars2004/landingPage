											<h3>Machine Learning Intern @ Spectrum (Summer 2025 Internship)</h3>
											<p> I developed predictive models and customer analytics solutions, including logistic regression for retention forecasting and clustering algorithms for customer segmentation. I built automated Python web scraping systems that delivered competitive intelligence to executives, and worked with large-scale datasets using AWS Redshift and MySQL to power machine learning initiatives that drove business decisions.
												</p>
											<h3>Software Engineer Intern @ OrgOrg (YC24) (Fall 2024)</h3>
											<p> I developed "BrewMates," a social networking feature for the OrgOrg suite using NextJS, React, and PostgreSQL that enabled employees to initiate coffee chats and enhance workplace social connections. I created mockups and wireframes in Figma while collaborating with professional UI/UX designers to bring concepts to life. I improved team connectivity by building "Go Links" for seamless platform navigation and participated in code reviews and development cycles, gaining valuable experience in collaborative software development environments.
												</p>
											
											<h3>SWE Fellow @ Headstarter AI (Summer 2024 Fellowship)</h3>
											<p>I deployed a SaaS flashcard application using Figma, React, Next.js, Firebase, Clerk, and Vercel with agile methodologies and CI/CD practices. The product integrated Gemini AI API for dynamic content generation and Stripe API for payment processing. I led a team of 4+ engineering fellows through the complete development lifecycle from design to deployment using MVC architecture patterns. I participated in weekly technical sessions with engineers from Google, Y Combinator, and Amazon to stay current with emerging technologies and industry best practices.</p>

											<h3>AI Prompt Engineer & Beta Tester @ UIUC: Illinois App (Fall 2023)</h3>
											<p>Designing and refining AI prompts to understand the appâ€™s capabilities, improving user interaction. Performing comprehensive testing and documenting prompt engineering results to ensure high accuracy and reliability of AI responses and to provide valuable insights for future response development. </p>
											
											<h3>Course Assistant @ UIUC: CS124 (Java) (Fall 2023)</h3>
											<p>I instructed a class of 3,800+ students in Java programming and software engineering fundamentals. Through dedicated office hours and personalized guidance, I helped students overcome challenging concepts, resulting in a 16% improvement in overall class performance on programming projects.</p>
											
											<h3>Private SAT Tutor</h3>
											<p>I launched and scaled a successful SAT tutoring business that generated over $12,000 in revenue and expanded operations by 12% through training additional tutors. I conducted both individual and group tutoring sessions, helping students achieve an average score improvement of 110+ points. I built a custom website using React with user authentication and Calendly integration to streamline client scheduling and business operations. </p>
